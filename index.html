            <h1>How I stayed committed to learning</h1>
            <p>I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning,
                then try to create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing 
                projects. <br>While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most 
                things about my journey with the world.
            </p>
            <h1>How I got started</h1>
            <p>I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what 
                I was learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect to what 
                I learned but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words. <br>
                That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realised that posting my learning summaries
                was also helping others learn and stay motivated.
